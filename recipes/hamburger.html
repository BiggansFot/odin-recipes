        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A hamburger is a perfect meal for the hungry person. It is (relatively) fast to make, flexible with ingredients and tasty for even the most picky eater.</p>
        <p>Excluding the majority of ingredients, here is a list of what you need</p>

        <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong> <em>4 burgers</em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread (burger buns are not a necessity)</li>
            <li>800g minced meat (preferably ground chuck)</li>
            <li>Cheese slices</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Whatever other topping of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by dividing the meat into four equal balls. Put some oil in a pan on medium heat and place the balls of meat in it. Immediately press them flat with a spatula and fry them on both sides until the middle is no longer red.</li>
            <li>When the patties is done grab the sliced cheese and place them on top of the patties and leave them on the pan until the cheese has melted.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of bread on four plates. Spread out some mayonnaise and place the finished patties on top.</li>
            <li>Place whatever other toppings you'd like (salad leaves, pickles, onion and bbq-sauce for example).</li>
            <li>Top the burger with a second slice of bread and serve with fries.</li>
        </ol>
